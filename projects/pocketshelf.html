      <h2>Context & Overview</h2>
      <p>
        PocketShelf began as a class project in a mobile application development course, where the goal was to design and build a mobile app from concept to implementation. I led the product design for the project, focusing on defining the experience, user flows, and interface design, while collaborating with teammates during development.
      </p>
      <p>
        While many reading apps emphasize progress tracking or social features, I wanted to explore how a mobile experience could better support organization and reflection, treating books not just as items to check off, but as a more memorable experience
      </p>
      <p>
        The product was designed as a mobile-first experience to support quick interactions, visual browsing, and lightweight reflection throughout a user’s reading journey.
      </p>

      <h3>The Problem</h3>
      <p>Many readers struggle to keep track of what they’ve read, what they want to read next, and what they’ve taken away from those books. Tools already out there often feel overly social, rigid, or transactional, sometimes prioritizing completion metrics over personal meaning.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Readers want a simple way to organize books without friction</li>
        <li>Important moments, quotes, or reflections are easily forgotten</li>
        <li>Switching between multiple tools (notes apps, bookmarks, reading trackers) creates fragmentation</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Understanding User Needs</h3>
      <p>Through early exploration, research, and analysis of existing reading apps, we focused on a few core user needs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Readers want to visually browse their collection in a way that feels personal </li>
        <li>They need a lightweight way to capture memories, quotes, or thoughts while reading </li>
        <li>The experience should feel calm and intentional, not gamified or competitive </li>
        <li> Core actions should be fast and accessible on mobile </li>
      </ul>
      <p>These helped to build both the structure of the app and its later implementation.</p>

      <h3>Defining the Experience</h3>
      <p>As a team, we took apart and thought of Craft Connect as the broad system rather than a single feature. We identified key system components like users, materials, tutorials, and local communities and how they would interact.</p>
      <img src="../media/craftconnect/ccsystemdiagram.png" width="700px" class="center-image" alt="System/Class Diagram">

      <h3>Technical Feasibility & Implementation</h3>
      <p>We implemented an early version of Craft Connect to validate technical feasibility and explore how the concept translated into a real application. Working with React and JavaScript, we focused on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Translating core features into functional components</li>
        <li>Identifying early limitations around complexity, state management, and scalability</li>
        <li>Understanding the agile process and delegating tasks to complete a full application</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Redesign & Improvements</h3>
      <p>Revisiting the project independently, I refined the scope and visual direction:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduced feature clutter to highlight core flows</li>
        <li>Prioritized accessibility and clarity across all screens</li>
        <li>Redesigned visual style to reflect the creative community</li>
      </ul>
      <img src="../media/craftconnect/ccappflow.png" width="500px" class="center-image" alt="Craft Connect intro image">


      <h3>Core App Flows</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Discovering and saving craft projects</li>
        <li>Offering or requesting surplus materials nearby</li>
        <li>Finding tutorials, whether video-based or written</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Wireframes & Final UI</h3>
      <p>Low-fidelity wireframes were used to test layout and navigation, which then informed high-fidelity designs in Figma, emphasizing:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clear entry points for beginners</li>
        <li>Progressive disclosure of features</li>
        <li>High color contrast, spacing, and readable typography</li>
      </ul>
      <img src="../media/craftconnect/ccwireframes.png" alt="Wireframes">

      <h3>Final UI</h3>
      <p>I translated the wireframes into high-fidelity designs in Figma, prioritizing clarity, accessibility, and consistency.</p>

          <p>The map lets users browse trade listings nearby, based on a distance they choose themselves. It helps them connect with others in their area while setting clear limits on how far they're willing to travel to pick up materials or supplies.</p>
          </div>
        <div class="txtright">
          <p>The listing feature shows users trade posts that match both their selected tags and their chosen mile radius. Once a listing catches their interest, they can start a conversation with the owner directly through the platform to coordinate the exchange.</p>

              The home screen displays algorithm-recommended projects, showing
              the user both the project’s rating and the estimated time needed
              to complete it.
            </p>
      
            <p>
              Users can also save projects to revisit later. The “like” feature
              was intentionally left out to avoid creating the kind of toxic,
              competitive environment often found on social media.

              instruction guides in text format. When a user highlights a
              hyperlinked keyword or important term, a pop-up page appears with
              a brief summary of the topic.

      <h3>Reflection & Next Steps</h3>
      <p>Revisiting Craft Connect allowed me to practice stepping back from a broad concept and making focused product decisions. If I continued the project, I would:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Conduct usability testing with beginner crafters</li>
        <li>Refine onboarding based on real feedback</li>
        <li>Explore moderation tools to support healthy communities at scale</li>
      </ul>
