      <h2>Context & Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Craft Connect began as a collaborative team project in a software design course where the goal was to design and build a unique application from scratch. In a group of four, we researched user needs, defined product requirements, and scoped a platform aimed at helping crafters discover new skills, exchange surplus materials, and connect with local creative communities.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the course ended, I revisited the concept independently and reimagined it as a focused product design case study, refining the scope, simplifying the experience, and translating the idea into a usable, technically feasible application.
      </p>

      <h3>The Problem</h3>
      <p>Many people interested in creative hobbies face a fragmented and frustrating experience:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Beginners struggle to find clear starting points and trustworthy tutorials</li>
        <li>Experienced crafters often have leftover materials with no easy way to share them</li>
        <li>Craft communities are scattered across forums and social platforms, often with poor moderation and low discoverability</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Initial Steps & Team Direction</h3>
      <p>As a team, we took apart and thought of Craft Connect as the broad system rather than a single feature. We identified key system components like users, materials, tutorials, and local communities and how they would interact.</p>

      <h3>Key User Needs</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>New crafters need a low-pressure way to discover projects without feeling overwhelmed</li>
        <li>Users with extra materials want a simple, local-first way to share or exchange supplies</li>
        <li>Community members want safer, more positive interactions than existing forums provide</li>
        <li>All users need clear navigation and accessibility regardless of technical experience</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Technical Feasibility & Implementation</h3>
      <p>We implemented an early version of Craft Connect to validate technical feasibility and explore how the concept translated into a real application. Working with React and JavaScript, we focused on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Translating core features into functional components</li>
        <li>Identifying early limitations around complexity, state management, and scalability</li>
        <li>Understanding the agile process and delegating tasks to complete a full application</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Redesign & Improvements</h3>
      <p>Revisiting the project independently, I refined the scope and visual direction:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduced feature clutter to highlight core flows</li>
        <li>Prioritized accessibility and clarity across all screens</li>
        <li>Redesigned visual style to reflect the creative community</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Core App Flows</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Discovering and saving craft projects</li>
        <li>Offering or requesting surplus materials nearby</li>
        <li>Finding tutorials, whether video-based or written</li>
      </ul>

      
      <h3>Wireframes & Final UI</h3>
      <p>Low-fidelity wireframes were used to test layout and navigation, which then informed high-fidelity designs in Figma, emphasizing:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clear entry points for beginners</li>
        <li>Progressive disclosure of features</li>
        <li>High color contrast, spacing, and readable typography</li>
      </ul>
      <img src="../images/ccwireframes.png" alt="System/Class Diagram">

      <h3>Reflection & Next Steps</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Conduct usability testing with beginner crafters</li>
        <li>Refine onboarding based on real feedback</li>
        <li>Explore moderation tools to support healthy communities at scale</li>
      </ul>
